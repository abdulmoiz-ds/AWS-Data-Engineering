Everything an AWS Data Engineer should know
Now you can Visualize AWS S3 Data in AWS QuickSight directly without using AWS Lambda function. You don't have to make crawlers to read data from AWS S3. You just have to put your data in S3 bucket and then connect your AWS S3 to AWS QuickSight. Then you can make your attractive dashboards using AWS QuickSight.
# Steps to connect AWS S3 Bucket with AWS QuickSight
1. Step 1: Creating S3 Bucket
2. Step 2: Installing AWS CLI
3. Step 3: Creating IAM roles
4. Step 4: Creating AWS QuickSight Account
5. Step 5: Upload S3 Data to QuickSight
